  "Translates a resource_watch/diff to a change plan for corresponding resource nodes.

  The change plan produced by resource-change-plan below has the following keys:
  * new - a list of resources to create new resource nodes for
  * delete - a list of resource nodes to remove - either because they were really removed or because they have been replaced
  * transfer-overrides - a list of pairs of new resource & old node. The resource should be in :new, and any override nodes that used to have old node as override-original will be transferred to the newly created resource node.
  * transfer-outgoing-arcs - a list of pairs resource & list of [label [target node target label]]. The connections will be added to the resource node corresponding to the resource.
  * mark-deleted - a list of resource nodes to be marked as deleted
  * invalidate-outputs - a list of resource nodes (stateless) whose outputs should be invalidated
  * redirect - a list of [resource node new resource], the resource nodes :resource will be reset to new resource."
